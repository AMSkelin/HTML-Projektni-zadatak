			<h2>2020 Mercedes-Benz EQV</h2>
			<p class="description">As the next member of the Mercedes-Benz EQ family, the EQV combines emission-free mobility with impressive driving abilities, high functionality and aesthetic design.</p>
			<p>The technical highlights include a range of 405 kilometres and the rapid charging of the high-voltage battery from 10 to 80 per cent in less than an hour. The EQV also offers ultimate comfort in the interior and unparalleled flexibility. Customers can also choose between two different wheel bases.The electric drive train (eATS) of the EQV is situated on the front axle under the dynamic front end of the car with a charging connection in the bumper. It has a peak output of 150 kW. The electric motor, the transmission with a fixed gear ratio, the cooling system and the power electronics constitute a highly integrated, compact unit.</p>
			<p>The power is provided by a lithium ion battery under the floor of the vehicle. Its low, central location also has a positive effect on the handling characteristics of the EQV. A top speed of up to 160 km/h also ensures that you quickly get to where you are going outside an urban environment.</p>
			<p>s standard the EQV is equipped with a water-cooled on-board charger (OBC) with a capacity of 11 kW, making it suitable for AC charging at home or at public charging stations. The battery, which has a usable capacity of 90 kWh, facilitates a maximum range of 405 kilometres⁴. The installation of the battery in the space below the floor means that all of the space is available, with no impact on the interior of the vehicle. This means that the fully electric MPV from Mercedes-Benz also meets the highest standards in terms of functionality and variability and covers a large number of applications.</p>
			<p> In the private sphere, for example, families benefit from a multitude of seating configurations as well as a good conscience from producing zero local emissions. Six individual seats, on the other hand, turn the EQV into a representative shuttle vehicle that meets all of the requirements for the high-quality transportation of people with a comfortable and particularly quiet driving experience. The flexible installation of individual or bench seats also allows the EQV to be converted into a seven- or even an eight-seater.</p>
			<p>The refinement of MBUX specifically for EQ is a particular highlight. In the high-resolution, ten-inch media display, the EQ tile in the main menu serves as a central point of access to the specific displays and settings. These include the charging current, departure time, energy flow and consumption histogram. The media display can also be used to operate the navigation and Mercedes me Charge functions, as well as the driving modes.</p>
			<p>One of the strengths of MBUX is its intelligent voice control with natural language comprehension, which is activated by the keyword “Hey Mercedes”. The voice control supports many infotainment functions (e.g. destination input, phone calls, music selection, writing and hearing messages, weather forecast), as well as numerous convenience functions such as climate control/lighting. And MBUX also applies its strengths in combination with the Mercedes me App outside the vehicle. EQV drivers can plan their destinations from the home or office, enter a departure time and bring the interior to the desired temperature.</p>
